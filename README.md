<h3>Problem situation</h3>

The issue we plan on investigating is the lack of participation in elections, and specifically compare voter turnout in midterm and presidential elections. We believe that everyone living in the states such as taxpayers are stakeholders in voter participation because whoever is elected will play a large role in laws and policies that may or may not be passed that can affect our daily lives. In addition, people that are apart of marginalized communities are heavily impacted because when these groups are underrepresented or don’t exercise their right to vote, people who are elected into office generally don’t have diverse opinions or backgrounds.

<h3>What is the problem?</h3>

This is an issue because some people aren’t given the proper education on how important voting is whether it’s on the local, state, or federal level, because they may believe that their vote doesn’t count.  It has been shown that socioeconomic factors are associated with whether or not people grow the habit of voting which can include younger people not wanting to vote, cultural background, such as family members being citizens vs. naturalized, or even having family members incarcerated that no longer have a right to vote, which decreases the chance of family members voting. Overall when this happens, there is not a proper representation.

<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>

A strong and transparent democracy needs to have adequate participation from citizens. As a result, low voter participation hurts the citizenry because they are not able to gain full support from its citizens in terms of their decision making. When voters make their voices heard, there tends to be stronger support for government actions because voters have put in the time to elect someone on their platform. Especially for districts that have low voter participation, their incumbent may not accurately represent their interests and this can change greatly through greater participation.

<h3>How will it be addressed?</h3>

We will take a look at voter participation rates for various years such as midterms and presidential years. Additionally, we will potentially look at how participation varies from positions at the top of the ballot to those that are down the ballot, which may seem less important or influential. If there are certain precincts or areas that tend to have lower voter participation then campaigns would be able to use this information to reach more voters to convince them to vote.

<h3>Research Questions</h3>

- How does the level of voter participation influence or even guarantee the selection of a candidate of some political party?
- How does voter participation vary across different positions or races on the ballot?

<h3>Possible Data Sets</h3>

Washington State Election County Registration Counts  
https://www.sos.wa.gov/elections/research/county-registration-counts.aspx  

This is one example of a data set that is useful for counting the number of registered and unregistered voters by county, which could provide some geographical hints to possible trends in voter participation. This specific data set also has more statistics for participation based on various demographic traits.
The data set has 39 observations--one for each county--and 12 different attributes for each observation, which are divided into 3 different tables for easier viewing.


Washington State Population & Demographics  
https://ofm.wa.gov/washington-data-research/population-demographics/population-estimates/estimates-april-1-population-age-sex-race-and-hispanic-origin

We could tie this in to the voting data to observing and analyzing how representative voter registration and participation is relative to each region’s demographic features and growth. This data could be used in conjunction with voting data to possibly see how voter participation and demographic shift are related.
One of the selected data sets of interest has 7200 observations spread across the years 2010-2018, with each observation having 25 attributes, but specifically 10 which would the attributes that we might focus on in terms of demographics.


<h3>Info Visualizations</h3>

This image shows a different type of visualization, where each type of election and its respective voter turnout as a percentage is graphed across years. This kind of representation gives a good representation of the state's overall voter interest in different elections and events.

![](/media/voterturnout.png)  
This visualization, although across the contiguous United States instead of just Washington state, is useful for simply detailing different levels of voter participation with different shades of colors. This is a good representation for depicting geographical trends in voting, and can be extended to other proportions as well. Another version of this for Washington State is included within our media folder.

<h3>Team Work Commitments</h3>

(a) Weekly group meetups on Friday evenings--anything else we will communicate in section on Monday.  

(b) Individual Goals:  
Kevin: Use the data results to have a better understanding of how voter participation is affected by total land area.  
Zufan: Get a strong understanding of voter participation and how it has changed over time.  
Michael: Learn how to effectively manipulate and creatively visualize data to tell a story and suggest impacts.  
Anush: Learning about the impact of data manipulation and visualization, as well as the influence of information on voter participation.

(c) Group collaboration is facilitated over GroupMe chat and Google Drive.

(d) Good feedback is given without unnecessary over-criticism. The purpose of feedback is to suggest solutions and highlight the parts that need extra attention, and to help us navigate and work on the challenge together. Feedback should be given through GroupMe chat and Google Doc comments.


<h3>Project Questions/Comments</h3>

Nothing too fleshed out yet, but excited to get started and see what we can discover!

We don't really have set roles, but aim to more specifically designate once we start really working.
